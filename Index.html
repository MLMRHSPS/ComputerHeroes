                    <p>
                        This document explains the workings of 2 Android Apps, <a class='DCAppLink'>Electronics DC Circuit Analysis App</a> 
                        and the <a class='ACDCAppLink'>Electronics AC DC Circuit Analysis App</a>.  The Apps allows you to draw a circuit on
                        a grid, to solve the circuit and display the voltages, and currents.  The DC version 
                        <a class='DCAppLink'>Electronics DC Circuit Analysis App</a> allows this for DC Circuits, 
                        <a class='ACDCAppLink'>Electronics AC DC Circuit Analysis App</a> (coming soon) allows for solution of both type of
                        circuits DC or AC, and will also contains some additional special features. The branches entered may be voltage sources,
                        current sources, resistors, or 1 of 4 types of controlled sources. The AC version will allow for inductors, capacitors,
                        impedance and admittance branches.    The Apps have 4 main modes; [Nodes] [Branches] for entering data,
                        [Solve] for computing the solution to the circuit, and [Display] for displaying the data.

                <div class="chapter-body">
                    <div class="figure-div"><img src="images/Fig1.png" id="fig1" class="fig"><br /><h4>Fig. 1</h4></div>
                    <p>
                        The screen will come up blank (Fig. 1) The Mode button will be blue, and it will say DC Circuit on the black bar 
                        above that button. <br />
                        Note: If the Mode button does not say [Node], you should press that button, and on the screen that pops up press [Node] <br />
                        Note If the screen is not clear, then you can clear it by pressing the [Menu] button, and on the screen that pops up 
                        press [Clear Circuit] <br />
                        Near the bottom of the screen towards the left side (see fig .2)    touch on an intersection of the horizontal and vertical
                        lines.  The program will add a black circle with the number 0 in the middle. This is the ground node.<br />
                    </p>
                    <div class="figure-div"><img src="images/Fig2.png" id="fig2" class="fig"><br /><h4>Fig. 2</h4></div>
                    <p>
                        Step 2. Add a 2nd node by touching another intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines, this one near the top
                        of the screen and above the ground node. (See fig 2) <br />
                        Step 3. Add the 3rd node, once again by touching the intersection of 2 lines, this one to the right of the 2 previous
                        nodes, and between them vertically. (See fig 2) <br />
                        Step 4. Now we need to draw the branches between the nodes, so we must change the mode from [Node] to [Branch].  Click
                        the [Mode] button to bring up the [Choose Mode] screen.  And click Branches.<br />
                        Step 5. Place your finger on node 0 and draw a branch (resistor) from that node to node 2. It will bring up the Branch<br />
                        mini screen.  (See fig 3)  Notice that mini screen is partially translucent. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="figure-div"><img src="images/Fig3.png" id="fig3" class="fig"><br /><h4>Fig. 3</h4></div>
                    <p>
                        Note: when drawing branches, it must connect 2 nodes.   On the first node you may place your finger close to a node and
                        slide into a node.  And once a node has been chosen it will flash, and you can see the branch being drawn as you move your
                        finger. You may occasionally need to lift your finger off the screen, and touch the node you wish to connect.<br />
                        Step 6. In the yellow [Choose Type] select [R ] for “resistor” to bring up the next screen. See Fig 4.
                    </p>
                    <div class="figure-div"><img src="images/Fig4.png" id="fig4" class="fig"><br /><h4>Fig. 4</h4></div>
                    <p>
                        Touch the lightly colored box, next to the Value label and this will bring up the keyboard. Enter 6 by Clicking 6 on the
                        keyboard and then the [Return Key] and final the Red [ENTER BR] button.  The circuit screen will show an extended label which
                        has the information of the branch just entered <br />
                    </p>
                    <div class="figure-div"><img src="images/Fig5.png" id="fig5" class="fig"><br /><h4>Fig. 5</h4></div>
                    <p>
                        Touching the branch label can be done in 3 different ways for 3 different functions.  You can place your finger on the arrows
                        in the upper right corner of the label box and while not lifting it off the screen, move your finger to a new location and
                        once you have it where you would like, lift your finger.  You can also click on the label ( anywhere other than the upper
                        right corner) and it will allow you to modify the information, for that branch.  The 3rd function is after a circuit is solved
                        and is explained later in this document.<br />
                    </p>
                    <div class="figure-div"><img src="images/Fig6.png" id="fig6" class="fig"><br /><h4>Fig. 6</h4></div>
                    <p>
                        Step 7. Enter a branch parallel to the one just entered by again drawing a resistor from node 0 to node 2, and again select
                        Resistor for type and again give it a value of 6 <br />
                        Step 8. Draw a resistor branch from node 2 to node 1 and give it a value of 9.<br />
                        Step 9. Draw one more branch, a current source from node 0 to Node 2.   This time select [ I(s) ] for a current source from node
                        0 to Node 2.  Give it a value of 5.<br />
                    </p>
                    <div class="figure-div"><img src="images/Fig7.png" id="fig7" class="fig"><br /><h4>Fig. 7</h4></div>
                    <p>
                        You can use the arrows in the upper right corner of the label to move the labels to convenient locations.<br />
                        You are now ready to solve the circuit, which you have just drawn.  Click the [Mode] button, and choose [SOLVE].
                    </p>
                    <div class="figure-div"><img src="images/Fig8.png" id="fig8" class="fig"><br /><h4>Fig. 8</h4></div>
                    <p>
                        Notice that labels now have an additional line  at the bottom, which shows the branch voltage of each branch. There are also some
                        new buttons in the bottom area. These allow you to display the voltage, current and power of each branch.  While the program is
                        in display mode, there are some additional features available.  You can click on a label and view all the information for the
                        branch at one time. See Fig 9.  You can also click on a node and display the node voltage for that node.  The 2 screens also have
                        arrows that allow you to scroll through the branch and node information.<br />

                        Note about the naming of nodes.  Node names may contain 1 or 2 characters only.  Naming a node “0” is the same as making
                        it the ground node. A circuit must have a ground node, which will have a voltage of zero.  The other nodes are not
                        restricted.  It is possible to give 2 nodes the same name, if you do this then electrically the nodes are the same, and
                        will have the same node voltage.  For example the 2 circuits shown below are equivalent.  Note nodes can also be stretched<br />
                    </p>

                    <h4>Stretching a Node</h4>
                       <p>
                            The node menu also give the user the option of stretching a node.  Often the ground node in circuit schematics found in books
                            and magazines is stretched along the bottom horizontal.  Occasionally other nodes are stretched as well.  The Apps allow the
                            user to stretch a node in either the horizontal or vertical direction.  Stretching a node in 4 step process.  <br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>Step 1 Click on the Node that you wish to stretch.</li>
                                <li>Step 2 Choose either Stretch Horizontal or Stretch Vertical.  A node can only be stretched in one direction.</li>
                                <li>Step 3. The chosen node will flash.  If the user wants to stretch the node horizontally then the user should touch the
                                    screen to the right or left on the node. If the node is a single point or already a stretched node it will stretch in that
                                    direction.  Note: A node cannot be stretched on top of another node.</li>
                                <li>Step 4. The user can now add sub nodes onto the stretched node.  Sub nodes are added when a user clicks on a line at a 
                                    place where a node does not exist. If you click on a sub node (assuming that no branches are connected) it is removed.   Up 
                                    to 6 sub Nodes can be entered, not including the 2 ends of each node</li>
                            </ul>
                            Stretching a node vertically works similarly to horizontally except the node is stretched Up and down rather than right and left.<br />
                            It is important to note that the end points and the sub nodes of a node is where a branch is to connect to a node. A branch that
                            hits a stretched node anywhere else will not be connected.  In the figure below the 2 capacitors connect node 1 and 4.  The resistor
                            connects node 2 and node 3, it crosses node 1 but, since it does not a hit a sub node it does not connect to node 1 <br />

                        To draw the branches the user first puts the App in Branch Mode by clicking the Mode button and choosing Branch.
                        For DC Circuits there are 9 types of Branches, which the user can choose. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>R – Resistor</li>

                            <li>L – Inductor		- note not active in a DC Circuit</li>
                            <li>I(s) – Current Source</li>
                            <li>V(s) – Voltage Source</li>
                            <li>VCCS – Voltage Controlled Current Source</li>
                            <li>VCVS – Voltage Controlled Voltage Source</li>
                            <li>CCCS – Current Controlled Current Source</li>

                        </ul>
                        When the user draws a branch connecting 2 nodes they will be given a choice in a dropdown list and should use it to tell the app
                        what kind of branch they have just drawn.<br />
                        Depending on the type of branch, it may allow for the user to enter additional information.  The information to be entered, for
                        each branch is described first This is followed by a description of the  specific information required for certain types of branches.

                        The first line includes the Entry Box, which holds the name of the Branch.  The App chooses a name for the branch depending on the 
                        type of Branch, but the user may give the branch a different name.  For example the first resistor will given the unimaginative name 
                        of R1.<br />
                        The second line contains the branch type and the nodes (From and To) which the branch contains.  These are unchangeable by the user.<br />
                        The 3rd line is for the Value label, the Value Entry box, the value multiplier and finally the units of the branch. For example the
                        resistor has a multiplier drop down list of nothing, K (for Kilo), or M for Mega; and a resistor has a units of ohms.<br />
                        Every type of Branch has a checkbox near the bottom, which allows the user to add a line to the branch label with a note <br />
                        The 4 types of controlled source branches, VCCS, VCVS, CCCS, and CCVS allow for the user to select a branch which controls them.  For
                        a Voltage Controlled Source, any type of branch can be a controlled branch, for a Current Controlled Branch, the Control Branch must
                        be a resistor.  The control voltage for a control branch is the rise in voltage (which could be negative in value) from the Fr node to
                        the To Node.  The control current for a control branch is the current flow (which could be negative in value) from the Fr node to the
                        To Node.<br />
                        The voltage Source as well as the VCVS, and the CCVS have an addition option that other types of branches don’t have.  These have the
                        option of adding a resistor in line with the voltage source or controlled voltage source.  Circuits where all Voltage Sources are
                        paired with a resistor in series are in some ways easier for a computer to handle than lone voltage sources, however these Apps can
                        handle both types.<br />

                        Q. When Drawing a Branch from node to node, sometimes it doesn’t bring up the branch page.<br />
                        Ans.  Yes, sometimes this happens.  Usually when you slide into a  node, the App will act properly, but occasionally you may 
                        need to slide into the node again, or you may need  to lift your finger and then actually touch the 2nd node.<br /><br />

	                    Q.  How big a circuit can the App Handle? <br />
                        Ans.  You may enter circuits with up to 24 branches, and 20 nodes.  You cannot display the node equations of a circuit with
                        more than 5 branches<br /><br >

                        Q. Can you draw say a [resistor] and then choose say [Current Source] as the branches type.<br />
                        Ans.  Yes, although this would be confusing it is possible to do this.<br />

                        This App will allow you to draw a DC Circuit on a grid, to solve the circuit and display node voltages, branch voltages, branch
                        currents and branch powers.  Branches may be current sources, voltage sources (with or without a built in resistor in series),
                        resistors, or 4 types of controlled sources VCCS, CCCS,  VCVS, CCVS<br />

                        coming soon! [Anticipated release Sept 4, 2020]<br /><br />
                        The Apps can do everything the DC app can do, PLUS<br />
                        Can also solve AC Circuits.<br />
                        Allows Additional types of branches Impedance and Admittance<br />
                        Can Show Circuit Equations for both AC and DC Circuits<br />
                        Can compute the Norton and Thevenin equivalent for both AC and DC Circuits<br />
